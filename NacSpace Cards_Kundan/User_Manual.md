### Poker Rules
- Each player is dealt five cards.
- Players evaluate their hands based on standard poker rankings (e.g., Royal Flush, Straight Flush).
- The player with the highest-ranking hand wins.

### Blackjack Rules
- Each player starts with two cards; they can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
- The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than that of other player without exceeding it (busting).
- Card values are as follows:
  - Number cards are worth their face value.
